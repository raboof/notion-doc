\label{chap:prelim}

The purpose of this chapter to explain some of key concepts and
relations you need to understand before reading the following
chapters. These include modules explained in section \ref{sec:modules}
and the Ion class and object hierarchies, section \ref{sec:objects}.


\section{Modules}
\label{sec:modules}

Ion has been designed so that the 'ion' executable only implements some
basic services on top of which very different kinds of window managers
could be build by loading the appropriate 'modules'. On modern system
these modules are simply dynamically loaded \file{.so} libraries. On 
more primitive systems, or if you want to squeeze total size of the 
executable and libraries, the modules can optionally be statically 
linked to the main binary, but must nevertheless be loaded with the
\fnref{load_module} function.

If no modules are loaded, all client windows appear in full screen mode.
To get better window management support, one or more workspace modules
should be loaded. Currently the \file{ionws} and \file{floatws}
workspace modules are provided. The formed provides the tiled workspaces 
familiar from older versions of Ion, while the latter provides the PWM
flavour of conventional workspaces with freely ''floating'' windows.

Workspace modules alone don't yet make the WM very usable. Better
input capabilities are achieved through the \file{query} and \file{menu}
modules. So-called drawing engines are also implemented as a modules,
but they are not discussed here; see chapter \label{chap:gr}.

The stock configuration for the 'ion' executable loads all the modules
mentioned above. The stock configuration for the 'pwm' executable (which
differs from the 'ion' executable in a few configuration details, such
as Xinerama usage) does not load the \file{ionws} module.
